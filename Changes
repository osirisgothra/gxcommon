Revision history for gxcommon

0.01    1-Feb-2015
        First version, initialized repos under a CPAN structure with module-builder
	File changes will be tracked with git
	Two git repositories: one for the CPAN structure, and another for the /src (submodule) which I expect to grow quite a bit over time in respect to the main repo
	The MANIFEST will be kept up to date to reflect BOTH repos
	Changes will only be logged here, and the LICENSE applies to both repositories
	Qxterm.h, Qxterm.cpp - the first common class to hit the streets - an xterm embedding widget for QT (and perl-qt) applications
	Qxterm.pm not planned at this time but the name is reserved for this use only
	.gitignore created, should ignore all swap, temp, and backup files
